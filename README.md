# Library-Management-System

This project is a complete library management system developed using a menu-driven approach. The application supports the following functionalities:
* Add book
* Add student
* Delete book
* Delete student
* Issue book
* Search book by ISBN
* Search book by title
* Search student by roll number

Using this system, librarians can easily manage their collection of books and keep track of student borrowing history. The system allows for adding and deleting books and students, issuing books to students, and searching for books or students by various criteria.
